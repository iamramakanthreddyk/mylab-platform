# MyLab Platform Overview

## Platform Pitch

MyLab is a secure, compliant platform for managing the lifecycle of lab samples across research labs, CROs, and analytical service providers. It ensures ALCOA+ compliance, auditability, and scalability for pharma workflows, enabling seamless collaboration while maintaining data integrity and regulatory standards.

## Problem Statement

In pharmaceutical research, sample management is fragmented across disparate systems, leading to data silos, compliance risks, and inefficiencies. Current solutions lack integrated support for external actors (e.g., CROs, analyzers) and regulated messaging, hindering collaboration in multi-stage projects.

## Solution

MyLab provides a unified platform with:
- **Organization Isolation**: Secure tenant boundaries for organizations and projects.
- **Immutable Lineage Tracking**: Full traceability of sample origins, transformations, and analyses.
- **Access Grants**: Flexible sharing mechanisms replacing rigid permissions.
- **Off-Platform Support**: Integration with external organizations and systems (e.g., Tekflow analyzers).
- **Compliant Messaging**: Project-based communication with audit trails and difficulty levels.

## Business Model

- **Target Market**: Pharma companies, CROs, and labs (TAM: $26.7B).
- **Revenue Path**: SaaS subscriptions, premium features for compliance and analytics.
- **Go-to-Market**: Direct sales to pharma, partnerships with CROs.

## Key Actors

- **Lab Managers**: Oversee projects and compliance.
- **Scientists**: Manage samples and analyses.
- **External Partners**: CROs and analyzers with off-platform access.
- **Compliance Officers**: Monitor audit trails and messaging.

## Updated Features

- **Off-Platform Scenarios**: Support for external orgs like Tekflow, with data exchange via APIs.
- **Messaging System**: Project-based chat with compliance rules, starting with basic levels and evolving to advanced features.
